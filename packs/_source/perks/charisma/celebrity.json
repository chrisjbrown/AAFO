You get free drinks at  bars and you have a permanent 20% discount on all  items. Whenever you meet an NPC who isn't hostile, in  neutral standing towards you, or directly affiliated with a  faction; you may roll a Luck check with the DC equal to 30  - your Speech or Barter skill bonus. On a success, the  NPC knows who you are. You gain advantage on all  Charisma based skill checks with this NPC. Additionally,  you can lose your Karma Cap to have this NPC follow you  and your party. Obeying orders from you (within reason),  but won't outright hurt or kill themselves. If you dismiss  this NPC, or they die; you gain your Karma Cap back at  the beginning of the next game session</p>",
