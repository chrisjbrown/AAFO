To be lacking in so many  capabilities, but being blessed with such a tapestry of emotions.”  - Curie. </p><p></p><p>“Humans are the dominant species of Earth. In the  post–apocalyptic age, \"human\" is more specifically used to  denote those that have been more-or-less unaffected by  radiation as opposed to mutants like ghouls and super  mutants, even though said mutant types originate from  humans. Non–mutated humans are sometimes called  normals, smoothskins, humies, or bleeders by their mutant  counterparts.  Despite the existence of various mutations, humans are  still the most common humanoid creatures on Earth.  Post-nuclear humans, as a direct result of the radiation  and exposition to the Forced Evolutionary Virus and some  other biochemical agents released into the environment  during and after the Great War, exhibit more diversity,  primarily in genetic structure. The aforementioned factors  have resulted in an increased rate of mutations in humans,  although very few of these result in phenotypic changes.  Most of these changes are non-lethal, non-damaging  variations in the human DNA that simply increase the  gene pool variety. Also, humans with minor mutations, like  additional toes, skin lesions due to TDC infection,  permanent red eyes, permanent varicose veins, or  complete lack of hair are still considered to be humans.” </p><p> - Excerpt from the “Human” page written on the  Fallout Fandom Wiki.  </p><p></p><p>Age.</p><p>Humans reach adulthood in their late teens and  live less than a century.

Despite their zombie-like appearance, the  flesh of ghouls is not actually rotten. Intense and  prolonged radiation has ravaged their skin, much of their  flesh, and in some cases many of their ligaments. Despite  their infertility and in some cases mental deterioration,  they have greatly extended overall lifespans and are  immune to (and sometimes even healed by) background  radiation and/or nuclear fallout.  Ghouls typically can live well in human societies, but they  are nevertheless a minority. There do exist Ghoul  communities and cities.

Nothing!”  - Codsworth.  </p><p></p><p>“A robot is a machine that is capable of autonomously  completing tasks. Depending upon the robot, these tasks  may be simple or complex and may require little human  intervention or complete oversight. Robots had been  constructed by pre-War society to fill all niches and  occupations. From general-purpose utility droids to  full-fledged military battle machines, robots could be found  in almost any environment and function. Some of the  robots in the Fallout universe will attack immediately but  some will aid in battle or remain ambivalent.”  - Excerpt from the “Robot” page written on the  Fallout Fandom Wiki.  Age. Robots can live hundreds of years before their  inorganic materials begin to corrode and their  programming deteriorates. However, a Robot who keeps  consistent repairs is nigh immortal.  Inorganic Body. You cannot gain radiation levels, you  are immune to radiation damage and poison damage. You  cannot gain levels of bleeding. You gain no effects from  Chems, Drinks or Food. Additionally, you have no need to  breathe, sleep, eat, or drink.  Size. While there are many types of Robots, most were  built to maintain a similar size to humans. Handy’s are  about 2 and a half feet to 3 and a half feet in height but  hover 2 to 3 feet off the ground. Protectrons rarely were  built taller than 5 feet. And Robobrains typically sit around  5 and a half feet. Regardless, your size is medium.  Severed Limbs. Luckily for most robots, reattaching  limbs is commonplace when they break or fall off. If any of  your limbs are severed, you do not go into shock and they  can be reattached with 3 steel and 1 circuitry junk item.  When you or a creature reattaches a limb, it takes a  number of minutes equal to 10 - their or your crafting skill  bonus. If the amount of time is reduced to 0, it takes 6 AP  to reattach the limb instead.  Armor and Weapons. You can use armor and  weapons just as any other race would. If your robot  sub-type grants you a weapon, you can upgrade and  modify this weapon just like any other weapon. However,  you cannot use power armor.  </p><p>Robot Type. There are three types of robot that you  can choose from. Handy, Protectron, and Robobrain.  </p><p>Handy.  </p><p>“The Handy robot is a maintenance and construction robot  with multiple, multi-jointed appendages, which levitates  thanks to its powerful jet-powered engine. They were  generally in use as butlers, maintenance workers and  sometimes also employed as guards before the Great  War.”  - Excerpt from the “Mister Handy” page written on  the Fallout Fandom Wiki.  While oftentimes their name suggests a gender role,  “Mister Handy” or “Miss Handy” is simply a name to  describe the robot's model. Handy’s have multitudes of  voices, personalities, and names and can present  themselves as any gender.  Limbs and Targeted Attacks. Handy’s have a less  human shape to them than other robots, floating off the  ground with three appendages and three eyes attached to  a large round core. You have three arms, three eyes, and  can have up to three hands if you choose to have three  Grippers in the Incredible Multi-Talented Appliance section  below. You do not have a head, groin, or legs that can be  targeted by targeted attacks or severed. Instead; targeted  attacks to your eyes cost 2 less AP and creatures can  target your jet engine. The jet engine functions exactly the  same as a targeted attack to the legs, except the attack  costs 2 more AP. If your jet engine is severed, you fall  prone and cannot move until it is reattached.  Fuel. You require fuel to continue to operate. Every  week, 7 days, or 168 hours; you can spend 6 AP to fill  your tank with a gallon of fuel or six oil junk items which  are consumed upon use. If you fail to consume a gallon of  fuel after the week, you must succeed a DC 12 Endurance  check for each hour past 168. For each successful check,  the DC increases by 2. On a fail, you become unconscious  until another creature fills your tank with fuel. Alternatively,  you can load a fusion core into your chassis. If you do, you  can operate for 30 days without requiring fuel.  Jet Engine. You hover a few feet off the ground while  active and moving. You don't trigger any floor based traps  or activated effects. However, if you are knocked prone,  become stunned, or fall unconscious; you fall to the  ground.  Incredible Multi-Talented Appliance! Handy’s are  built with three special tools that are attached and built  into three of their arms. These tools and weapons can be  modified like any other weapon, only require one hand to  use, and do not cost AP to equip or stow. Additionally, they  cannot be detached from you unless the arm that the tool  or weapon is attached to is severed. Choose one tool or  weapon from the following list that is attached to your arm.  </p><p></p><p>Buzz Saw. A mechanical saw housed in a metal frame  used to cut wood, food, bodies, or debris. Melee Weapon.  12  5 Action Points. 1d8 slashing. Critical Hit: 20, x2, applies  bleeding. Special Properties: Cleave, Durable. (See page  47 for details on these properties).  Clippers.

Operating at similar efficiency to a human hand. If you do  not have at least two of these tools, you effectively only  have one hand. (This affects some weapons which have  the two handed, unwieldy, or kickback special properties  on page 55)  Torch. This kitchen tool emits a flame with an adjustable  nozzle for cooking, flambéing, taking care of pesky bug  nests, or lighting candles. Ranged Weapon, 10 ft. line. 5  Action Points. 1d10 fire. Ammo: fuel, 5 rounds. Special  Properties: Area of Effect, Durable, Incendiary (see page  56 for details on these properties).  </p><p></p><p>Protectron. </p><p>Protectrons have a glass dome on top of their heads that  acts as an ocular lens that allows the Protectron to scan  its surroundings and act accordingly. Although Protectrons  are rather slow and ponderous, their upper body can  swivel up to about 90 degrees to either side before having  to step into a different position, which means that they can  easily keep track of their target.  - Excerpt from the “Protectron” page written on the  Fallout Fandom Wiki.  Limbs and Targeted Attacks. Protectrons, while still a  robotic oddity, have a human-like shape and appendages.  You have two arms, two legs, two hands, two feet, a head,  and a torso. However, you do not have eyes or a groin  that can be targeted by normal targeted attacks or  severed.  Reinforced Plating. Your DT increases by 1 even if  you aren’t wearing armor.  Slow. Protectrons can only spend a maximum of 6 AP  on movement during their turns.  Protect and Serve. Protectrons are built with a special  tool that is attached and built into one of their arms. These  tools and weapons can be modified like any other  weapon, only require one hand to use, and do not cost AP  to equip or stow. Additionally, they cannot be detached  from you unless the arm that the tool or weapon is  attached to is severed. </p><p>Choose one tool or weapon from  the following list that is attached to your arm. </p><p>Taser.</p><p>Melee Weapon. 4 action points. 2d8 electricity  damage. Critical Hit: 20, x2 applies dazed. Special  Properties: Durable. (See page 47 for details on these  properties).  Laser. Ranged Weapon, Range: x10/x20. 4 Action Points.  1d8 laser. Critical Hit: 20, x2, applies burning. Ammo:  Fusion cell, 30 rounds. Special Properties: Durable.  Semi-Automatic.

Special Properties: Automatic: 2.  Durable (See page 56 for details on these properties).  </p><p>Robobrain. </p><p>“The Robobrain was designed from the ground up as a  multirole platform for use by military and civilian clients.  They are more flexible and powerful than robots due to the  fact that their central control and processing unit is an  actual brain, rather than an artificial facsimile. Coupled  with a robust, all-terrain tracked chassis and powerful  armaments, the Robobrain was on the forefront of a new  revolution in combat robotics.”  - Excerpt from the “Robobrain” page written on the  Fallout Fandom Wiki.  </p><p></p><p>Limbs and Targeted Attacks.</p><p>Robobrains have a  humanoid shape and appendages. You have two arms,  two hands, a head, and a torso. However, you do not have  legs, feet, eyes, or a groin that can be targeted by normal  targeted attacks or severed. Instead, creatures can target  your all terrain rollers. The rollers function exactly the  same as a targeted attack to the legs except they cannot  be severed.  All Terrain Rollers. You do not have to spend extra  AP to move through difficult terrain.  </p><p>NeuroTransmitters.</p><p>You are vulnerable to electricity  damage.

Originally planned to be super soldiers, the first  Super mutants were created by exposure to the Forced  Evolutionary Virus II from the vats of the Mariposa Military  Base in California. Other strains of Super mutants are  found throughout the wasteland created from various  sources, often varying in size and intelligence. Regardless  of their origin, all Super mutants were created by way of  the Forced Evolutionary Virus having mutated from  humans. With the creation of the FEV-II strain, scientists  were able to create powerful super-soldiers, exhibiting  superior physical prowess, resistance to combat damage,  aging, and disease, as well as a negligible loss of  intelligence and inevitable infertility.  People who were turned into mutants via would have their  skin turn a shade of green, yellow, or olive with their entire  body growing huge with more muscle mass being added  by the Virus. But those who were turned into mutants had  only fleeting memories of their human lives. They could  not breed, as the FEV turned them sterile, thus limiting the  generations of mutants.
